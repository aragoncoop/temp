  This repo has 1 goal: to help us approve, execute, and compensate work. We can build from there.

### What qualifies as "work?"

[AGP-40](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/6d2f51a988b13c6855cd8c1a955807f476d4cac9/AGPs/AGP-40.md) defines the deliverables the Aragon Cooperative is responsible for:
- Cooperative DAO bylaws
- Membership on-boarding and off-boarding process
- Token(s) (definition and) allocation.
- Governance procedures
- Formulating Coop Projects and Grants Proposals
- Management of Community Fund DAO applications
- Further Coop AGP application construction
- Documentation of practice (education & knowledge sharing)
- Dogfooding and documentation of Aragon tooling and workflow
- Further suitable community-led, signaled and proposed opportunities

<br>

### How do we decide who does what?

We vote. Any Aragon Cooperative member can submit a proposal to do work. To submit a proposal to do work, create an Issue in this repo, assign it to yourself, and tag it as a "work proposal". The [Example](https://github.com/aragoncoop/temp/issues/1) Issue shows what this looks like. Each work proposal will include:
- the AGP-40 deliverable that you’d like to work on
- the steps you’re going to take to move us towards shipping that deliverable
- the amount of time you think that’s going to take

If a you feel like there is work that should be done, but you do not have the time or expertise to do it you can still create an Issue proposing this work. This Issue will be tagged "work proposal" and "open" to indicate that any Cooperative member can assign the issue to themselves. If a Cooperative member wants to work on the Issue they can assign it to themselves, remove the "open" tag, and present it to the Cooperative for approval to start work.

Cooperative members are encouraged to comment with feedback and suggestions on any Issues tagged "work proposal." It is expected that these proposals will be modified as a result of community feedback.

When rough consensus has been reached that a "work proposal" Issue is something that the Aragon Cooperative wants to support, it should be submitted for a vote. This involves changing to tag to "pending" and creating a vote in the Aragon Cooperative DAO. The title of this vote in the DAO should be: the tag of the Issue ("work proposal"), the Issue#, and the title of the Issue. Aragon Cooperative members can then vote on if they think this "work proposal" should be eligible for funding. This vote is not a guarantee of funding. This is a vote to determine if the goal, scope, timeline, and member assigned to the proposal is something the Cooperative approves. If so, then that "work proposal" Issue will be eligible to request compensation when it is finished. This will allow all Cooperative members do work that has clear goals and expectations.

If a "work proposal" Issue is approved by the Aragon Cooperative, change the tag on the issue from "work proposal" to "approved."

<br>

### How do we verify work that has been done?

We vote. Aragon Cooperative members who did work that qualifies for funding will share their work with the group. They will do this by adding a report in the comments section of their "approved" Issue. The [Example](https://github.com/aragoncoop/temp/issues/1) Issue shows what this looks like. The comment on the Issue will include:
- the AGP-40 deliverable that you worked on
- the steps you actually took to move us towards shipping that deliverable and where we are now as a result
- the amount of time it actually took
- amount of billable time being requested

Once a work report has been added to the Issue, add an additional tag of "request for compensation" to the Issue. Then create a vote for your "request for compensation." This vote in the Aragon Cooperative DAO will include: the tag of the Issue "request for compensation", the Issue #, the name of the Issue. 

<br>

### How do we compensate work that has been done?

We vote. Cooperative members will review Issues tagged "request for compensation" and vote to release funds for that work. This means that funding is at the discretion of the Cooperative. If you did your best, but encountered an unknown roadblock the Cooperative can still choose to compensate you for your time. If you wasted time the Cooperative can also choose not to fund that time. If more work needs to be done, or the work was not satisfactory. the Cooperative can deny your funding request but suggest that you fix X, Y, or Z and then re-submit your request. It’s all up to the community.

<br>

### This is now.

This proposal will work now using no additional tooling.

<br>

### How do we modify this protocol?

We vote. To suggest changes to this protocol, any Cooperative member can create an Issue and tag it "meta proposal." Comments and feedback are encouraged and the proposal is expected to be modified accordingly. When rough consensus is achieved that the "meta proposal" is something that the Aragon Cooperative supports, create a vote in the Aragon Cooperative DAO. The vote will include: the tag of the Issue ("meta proposal"), the Issue #, the name of the Issue. If the vote passes the "meta proposal" can be enacted.
