    Temporary Aragon Cooperative DAO Workflow
  </a>
</h1>

This repo has 1 goal: to help us approve, execute, and compensate work. We can build from there.

<br>

### What qualifies as "work?"

[AGP-40](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/6d2f51a988b13c6855cd8c1a955807f476d4cac9/AGPs/AGP-40.md) defines the deliverables the Aragon Cooperative is responsible for:
- Cooperative DAO bylaws
- Membership on-boarding and off-boarding process
- Token(s) (definition and) allocation.
- Governance procedures
- Formulating Coop Projects and Grants Proposals
- Management of Community Fund DAO applications
- Further Coop AGP application construction
- Documentation of practice (education & knowledge sharing)
- Dogfooding and documentation of Aragon tooling and workflow
- Further suitable community-led, signaled and proposed opportunities

<br>

### How do we decide who does what?

We vote. Any Aragon Cooperative member can submit a proposal to do work Monday through Friday. The way to submit work is to create an Issue in this repo. The [Example]() Issue shows what this looks like. It will include:
- the AGP-40 deliverable that you’d like to work on
- the steps you’re going to take to move us towards shipping that deliverable
- the amount of time you think that’s going to take

If a Cooperative member feels like there is work that should be done, but does not have the time or expertise to do it they can still create an Issue with the proposal. This proposal will be tagged "open" and any Cooperative members can self select to assign the issue to themselves.

Throughout the week Cooperative members can comment on proposals and modify them within the GitHub Issue comments. 

On the weekend Aragon Cooperative members will vote on which work requests they want to approve for potential funding. This will allow people to start the week with clear goals and expectations.

<br>

### How do we verify work that has been done?

We vote. At the end of the week Aragon Cooperative members who did work that qualifies for funding will present a report to the group. This report will be an extension of the original work request proposal for that Issue. The [Example]() Issue shows what this looks like. It will include:
- the AGP-40 deliverable that you worked on
- the steps you actually took to move us towards shipping that deliverable and where we are now as a result
- the amount of time it actually took

<br>

### How do we compensate work that has been done?

We vote. At the end of the week Cooperative members will review work that has been done and vote to release funds for that work. This means that funding is at the digression of the Cooperative. If you did your best, but encountered an unknown roadblock the Cooperative can still choose to compensate you for your time. If you wasted time the Cooperative can also choose not to fund that time. It’s really all up to the community.

### The Temporary Aragon Cooperative DAO is live

As stated, any proposal to the Aragon Cooperative DAO will take 7 days to be approved or denied. We need to engage, communicate, and make decisions faster than that. With this in mind, I've deploying a Rinkeby DAO. This DAO will serve as a coordination tool to help us make decisions. It is completely opt-in and voluntary. It will not be able to move funds. It will not be binding beyond a social contract. It will, however, allow us to start using it immediately. We can test it out for a week or two and then, if we want, vote to move this process to the Aragon Cooperative mainnet DAO.

The DAO parameters are as follows:
- support: 66%
- quorum: 33%
- duration: 48hrs

These parameters imply that most people who self select to use this this model will share similar goals and thus be able to achieve a 66% support threshold. Furthermore, since the process is opt-in and non-binding, social consensus is essential for votes to be followed through on. Discussions will happen during the week and members will check in over the weekend to vote.

Membership will be dead simple. If you are a [member](https://github.com/aragoncoop/membership/) of the Aragon Cooperative you are a member of the Aragon Cooperative Temporary DAO. This is already done. 

This DAO operates on trust and social contracts. These are the expectations of membership:
- voting will only happen on the weekends
- votes created Monday through Friday will be viewed as illegitimate.
- votes to approve compensation for work done in the Aragon Cooperative Temporary DAO will be mirrored on the Aragon Cooperative mainnet DAO
- if you voted in an ACL vote to compensate work, you will also vote the same way on the mainnet DAO

### Notes

The original proposal and discussion for this model can be found [here](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-for-a-temporary-aragon-cooperative-workflow/966)

While setting up the temp DAO I granted my account permission to manage tokens so that I could create them for all Aragon Cooperative members. Now that I'm not the majority token holder I cannot revoke that permission from myself without a vote from the community. There are open votes for this in the DAO now.
